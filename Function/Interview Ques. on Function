### Some Important Question on interview
Q1. What is a function in JavaScript?

Answer:
A function in JavaScript is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It helps reduce code duplication and improves readability. Functions can take inputs (parameters) and may return a value.
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

Q2. Difference between function declaration and function expression?
Answer:
A function declaration is hoisted, meaning it can be called before it is defined.
A function expression is not hoisted and is stored in a variable.
// Function Declaration
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello");
}
// Function Expression
const greet = function() {
  console.log("Hello");
};

Q3. What is hoisting in functions?

Answer:
Hoisting is JavaScript’s behavior of moving function declarations to the top of their scope during execution. Only function declarations are hoisted, not function expressions or arrow functions.
Q4. What is an arrow function?
Answer:
An arrow function is a shorter syntax for writing functions introduced in ES6. It does not have its own this and is commonly used for callbacks.
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
Q5. Difference between arrow function and normal function?
Answer:
Arrow functions do not have their own this, arguments, or prototype, while normal functions do. Arrow functions are not hoisted.
Q6. What is a callback function?
Answer:
A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and executed later.
function greet(name, callback) {
  callback();
  console.log(name);
}
greet("Saurav", () => console.log("Hello"));

Q7. What is a higher-order function?
Answer:
A higher-order function is a function that either takes another function as an argument or returns a function.
Example: map(), filter(), reduce().
Q8. What is a closure?
Answer:
A closure is created when a function remembers variables from its outer scope even after the outer function has finished executing.
function outer() {
  let count = 0;
  return function inner() {
    count++;
    return count;
  };
}

Q9. What happens if a function does not return anything?
Answer:
If a function does not return a value explicitly, JavaScript returns undefined by default.
Q10. What is the this keyword in JavaScript?
Answer:
this refers to the object that is calling the function. Its value depends on how the function is invoked.
Q11. Output-based Question
console.log(add(2, 3));
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
Answer:
Output will be 5 because function declarations are hoisted.
Q12. Tricky Question
const add = (a, b) => {
  return
  a + b;
};
console.log(add(2, 3));
Answer:
Output is undefined because JavaScript inserts a semicolon after return.
