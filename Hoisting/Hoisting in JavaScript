###  
What is Hoisting?
- Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving variable and function declarations to the top of their scope during the compilation phase.
Before the code executes:
- Memory is allocated for variables.
- Memory is allocated for functions.
- Variable values are assigned later during execution.

--------------  JavaScript Execution Phases---------------
JavaScript runs code in two phases:
1️--- Memory Creation Phase
var → initialized with undefined
let and const → memory allocated but not initialized
Function declarations → entire function stored in memory
--- Execution Phase
Code runs line by line
Values are assigned to variables

---  Hoisting with var
console.log(a);
var a = 10;
 Internally JavaScript treats it as:
var a;            // memory allocated (undefined)
console.log(a);   // undefined
a = 10;
 Output:
undefined


✔ var is hoisted
✔ Default value is undefined

/ Hoisting with let
console.log(a);
let a = 10;

 Output:
ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
 Reason:
-----    let is hoisted but stays in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) until it is initialized.

**** Hoisting with const
console.log(a);
const a = 10;
 Output:
ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
✔ const is hoisted
✔ It remains in the Temporal Dead Zone
✔ Initialization is mandatory

==== Function Hoisting
greet();

function greet() {
  console.log("Hello");
}
// Output:
Hello

- Function declarations are fully hoisted.
=== Function Expression (Not Fully Hoisted)
greet();
var greet = function() {
  console.log("Hello");
};
// Output:
TypeError: greet is not a function
 -- Only the variable is hoisted (undefined), not the function definition.
--  Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)
- The Temporal Dead Zone is the time between:
- When a variable is hoisted (memory allocated)
- And when it is initialized
- During this time, accessing the variable causes a ReferenceError.
Applies to:
let

const

Memory View
Creation Phase (Memory Allocation)

var a        → undefined
let b        → TDZ
const c      → TDZ
function sum → full function stored

Execution Phase

a = 10
b = 20
c = 30

var vs let vs const (Hoisting)
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;

console.log(b); // ReferenceError
let b = 20;
